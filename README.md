Kaggle project for permutation puzzle  
Python and C++ implementation but performance is similar  
A* Algorithm to search shortest path (Works only for 2x2 cubes and other low dim puzzles)  
TODO:  
Include wildcards  
IDA* Algorithm doesn't work due to overoptimistic heuristic, include pattern database for 3x3 cubes  
Dimension reduction in higher level cubes
